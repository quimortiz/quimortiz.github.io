**Latest News**: I successfully defended my PhD in January 2024! 
For an in-depth look, check out my <a href="/assets/phd_thesis.pdf">thesis</a> and the presentation <a href="/assets/phd_slides.pdf">slides</a>.
I'm excited to continue my research journey as a Postdoc researcher at New York University, working with Prof. Ludovic Righetti in the Machines in Motion Laboratory.

====

Hello! I am Joaquim Ortiz-Haro, a Postdoc researcher at New York University (NYU), working with Prof. Ludovic Righetti in the Machines in Motion Laboratory.

I recently completed my PhD in robotics at the Technical University of Berlin ([TUB](https://www.tu.berlin/)) under the supervision of [Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/index.html) in the research group [Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://argmin.lis.tu-berlin.de/). My research interests are in Task and Motion Planning, optimization, and deep learning for robotics.

I studied Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor) and Mathematics (Master) at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en), Barcelona). As an undergrad student, I worked on different projects ranging from convex optimization and machine learning to localization and mapping in robotics, in collaboration with Gergely Neu (UPF), Nicolas Mansard (LAAS-CNRS), Bharath Sankaran (Scaled Robotics), and Joan Sol√† (IRI).

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborations or doing a MSc Thesis or research internship in our group. I am interested in projects on: A) merging nonlinear optimization and motion planning with supervised or reinforcement learning in robotics; B) closing the gap between task and motion planning and model predictive control.
