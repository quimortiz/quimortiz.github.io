Hello!

I am Joaquim Ortiz-Haro, a PhD student in robotics at the Technical University of Berlin ([TUB](https://www.tu.berlin/)) and the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)). My advisor is [Marc Toussaint](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/index.html) in the research group [Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://argmin.lis.tu-berlin.de/).

I studied Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor) and Mathematics (Master) at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en), Barcelona). 

Before starting the PhD, I worked in different projects ranging from convex optimization and machine learning to localization and mapping in robotics, in collaboration with Gergely Neu (UPF), Nicolas Mansard (LAAS-CNRS), Bharath Sankaran (Scaled Robotics) and Joan Sola (IRI).

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborations or doing a MSc Thesis in our group (priority will be given to students enrolled at TU Berlin). I currently have several open MSc projects to combine nonlinear optimization/motion planning with supervised/reinforcement learning, with an application to robotics.
