  abstract = {We consider time-optimal motion planning for dynamical systems that are translation-invariant, a property that holds for many mobile robots, such as differential-drives, cars, airplanes, and multirotors. Previous benchmarks have typically focused on comparing approaches within the same algorithmic class, eg, sampling-based approaches may be benchmarked using the open motion planning library (OMPL). We provide the first benchmark that compares search-, sampling-, and optimization-based time-optimal motion planning on multiple dynamical systems in different settings.}
