  abstract={
The optimal transport distance is a powerful and useful metric to compare probability distributions in statistics and machine learning. In contrast to alternative distance measures, the main drawback is the computational complexity.
Adding entropic regularization to the original linear program, we can find approximate solutions much faster (reducing complexity from O(n3) to O(n2), where n is the histogram size) using the Sinkhorn algorithm (iterative matrix scaling).
However, finding solutions with small error requires using small regularizations, which increases the number of Sinkhorn iterations. The dependence is k = O(e-2), where k is the number of Sinkhorn iterations and e the approximate error.
In this report, we have proposed an algorithm based on proximal regularization. It consists on solving a sequence of problems decreasing the regularization, and resembles the well-known heuristic e-scaling.
Using a follow the regularized leader analysis and novel bounds for this iterative and proximal regularized setting, we bound the complexity of our algorithm as O(n2/e3). However, this result depends on two still unproved assumptions, that we leave for future work.
We have not analyzed the experimental performance of the algorithm, but we believe it should be equivalent to e-scaling. This strategy has been shown to outperform the standard approach of solving only one scaling problem with very small regularization.
Moreover, one of the advantages of our algorithm and e-scaling is that they are any-time algorithms, producing better solutions as more computational time is available. }
